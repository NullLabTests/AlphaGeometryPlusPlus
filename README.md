# AlphaGeometry++

**AlphaGeometry++**: A Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Geometry Solver with Enhanced Adaptability and Explainability

## Overview

AlphaGeometry++ builds upon DeepMind's AlphaGeometry by integrating a neural language model with a symbolic deduction engine and a Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) for efficient logical inference. The project aims to solve complex geometry problems with improved adaptability and explainability.

## Key Features

- **Neural Language Model:** Suggests geometric constructions.
- **Symbolic Deduction Engine (DDAR):** Provides rigorous geometric proofs.
- **WAM Integration:** Executes efficient logical inferences.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Bridge:** Combines LM suggestions with symbolic reasoning.
- **Meta-Learning:** Adapts the solver to new problem types.
- **Explainability:** Outputs human-readable proofs and visualizations.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
