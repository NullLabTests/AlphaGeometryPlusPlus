# AlphaGeometry++

**AlphaGeometry++**: A Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Geometry Solver with Enhanced Adaptability and Explainability

WARNING THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS: I will return to this when I can.

## Overview

AlphaGeometry++ builds upon DeepMind's AlphaGeometry by integrating a neural language model with a symbolic deduction engine and a Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) for efficient logical inference. The project aims to solve complex geometry problems with improved adaptability and explainability.
